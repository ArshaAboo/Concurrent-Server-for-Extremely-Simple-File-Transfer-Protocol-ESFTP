# Concurrent-Server-for-Extremely-Simple-File-Transfer-Protocol-ESFTP

This project implements a concurrent FTP server and client system based on the Extremely Simple File Transfer Protocol (ESFTP) to enable reliable file transfers over TCP. The client takes a file name as input, establishes a TCP connection with the server, and sends the file in fixed-size chunks (1024 bytes). The server is designed to handle up to five simultaneous file transfer requests using multithreading, while additional requests are queued in FIFO order. Each transfer runs in a separate thread, ensuring efficient parallel processing. The system demonstrates core concepts of socket programming, concurrency, and reliable data transmission, providing a practical understanding of TCP-based communication for large file transfers.
